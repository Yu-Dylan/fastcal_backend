# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

\<concept\_spec>
concept CalendarSync \[User, Account]

purpose
commit events to external calendar providers and maintain consistency across multiple accounts

principle
after committing an event, it appears across all connected calendar accounts;
conflicts are detected by querying existing events across accounts;
system proposes ranked reschedule options when conflicts occur;
updates and cancellations propagate to all providers;
provider-specific event IDs are maintained for bidirectional sync

operational principle
after user connects Google Calendar and Outlook accounts,
user creates a validated draft event for 2pm Tuesday;
detectConflicts queries both accounts and finds existing event at 2pm in Google Calendar;
suggestReschedules proposes alternative times (3pm, 4pm, 1pm) that avoid conflicts;
user selects 3pm reschedule;
commit creates event in both Google Calendar and Outlook with provider-specific IDs;
later, user updates location;
update propagates change to both providers using stored IDs

state
a set of Account with
a user User
a provider Provider // "google", "outlook", "apple", "zoom"
credentials Map\<String,Any> // OAuth tokens, refresh tokens
a syncStatus SyncStatus // "connected", "disconnected", "error"
a lastSync DateTime

```
a set of SyncedEvent with
    a user User
    an internalId EventId // FastCal internal event ID
    providerIds Map<Provider,String> // provider-specific event IDs
    a syncedAt DateTime
    accounts Set<Account> // which accounts have this event

a set of Conflict with
    a user User
    a draftEvent DraftEvent
    existingEvents Set<EventId> // conflicting events
    a reason String // "time_overlap", "buffer_violation", "double_booking"

where Provider = "google" | "outlook" | "apple" | "zoom"
where SyncStatus = "connected" | "disconnected" | "error"

invariants
    every Account belongs to exactly one user
    credentials are encrypted at rest
    syncStatus reflects actual provider connection state
    every SyncedEvent has at least one provider ID
    providerIds keys match accounts in the synced event
```

actions
connectAccount(user: User, provider: Provider, credentials: Map\<String,Any>): Account
requires credentials are valid, provider is supported
effect creates account connection and validates credentials with provider
note returns account ID and sets syncStatus to "connected"
note stores encrypted credentials for future API calls

```
commit(user: User, event: CommittableEvent, accounts: Set<Account>): SyncedEvent
    requires event is validated, accounts belong to user, all accounts are connected
    effect creates event in each provider's calendar via API calls
    note stores mapping of internal ID to provider-specific IDs
    note returns synced event with all provider IDs
    note sets syncedAt timestamp for tracking

detectConflicts(user: User, draft: DraftEvent): Set<Conflict>
    requires draft exists
    effect queries all connected accounts for events overlapping with draft time range
    note checks both exact time overlap and buffer violations
    note returns set of conflicts with reasons
    note considers travel time buffers if specified in draft constraints

suggestReschedules(user: User, draft: DraftEvent, constraints: Map<String,Any>): List<Timespan>
    requires draft exists, conflicts were detected
    effect proposes alternative time slots that avoid conflicts
    note ranks suggestions by: proximity to original time, attendee availability, time-of-day preferences
    note respects constraints like working hours, day boundaries, minimum/maximum offsets
    note returns ranked list of timespans (start, end)

update(user: User, eventId: EventId, changes: Map<String,Any>)
    requires eventId is synced, changes contain valid field names
    effect propagates changes to all providers using stored provider IDs
    note handles partial failures gracefully (retries, marks account sync error)
    note updates syncedAt timestamp

cancel(user: User, eventId: EventId)
    requires eventId is synced
    effect removes event from all providers using stored provider IDs
    note removes SyncedEvent from state after successful deletion
    note handles partial failures (marks which providers succeeded)

disconnectAccount(user: User, account: Account)
    requires account exists, account belongs to user
    effect revokes credentials and marks account disconnected
    note does not delete events already committed to provider
    note removes account from future sync operations

refreshSync(user: User, account: Account)
    requires account exists, account is connected
    effect refreshes OAuth tokens if needed, validates connection
    note updates lastSync timestamp and syncStatus
    note can detect provider-side changes for bidirectional sync

getAccountStatus(user: User): Set<Account>
    effect returns all accounts for user with sync status and last sync time

getSyncedEvent(eventId: EventId): SyncedEvent?
    effect returns synced event with provider IDs, or none if not synced
```

notes
Provider integration challenges:
\- Each provider has different API schemas and rate limits
\- OAuth token refresh must happen transparently
\- Timezone handling varies by provider (some use IANA, others use Windows zones)
\- Virtual meeting links (Zoom, Teams) require separate API integration

```
Conflict detection strategies:
- Time overlap: events with intersecting time ranges
- Buffer violation: event starts/ends within required buffer of another event
- Double booking: multiple events at exact same time
- All-day events: special handling for day-long events

Reschedule ranking heuristics:
- Proximity: prefer times close to original (within same day > next day > next week)
- Time-of-day: prefer similar time of day (morning event â†’ morning slots)
- Attendee availability: check if attendees are free (requires access to their calendars)
- User preferences: respect working hours, avoid early mornings or late nights

Error handling:
- Provider API failures trigger retry logic with exponential backoff
- Partial sync failures mark specific accounts as "error" status
- User notifications for sync failures
- Event remains in FastCal even if provider sync fails

Security considerations:
- Credentials encrypted using AES-256
- OAuth tokens rotated regularly
- Scope limitations: only calendar read/write, not full account access
- User can revoke access at any time

Bidirectional sync (future enhancement):
- Detect events created directly in provider calendars
- Sync provider-side changes back to FastCal
- Conflict resolution when same event modified in multiple places
```

\</concept\_spec>

Please implement the CalendarSync concept following the specification above and the implementation guidelines.

Key requirements:

* Use MongoDB collections with PREFIX namespace separation
* Define internal types: Account, SyncedEvent, Conflict
* For the provider integration, create a **mock/stub implementation** (no actual calendar API calls yet)
  * Comment where real API calls would go (Google Calendar API, Outlook Graph API, etc.)
  * Mock should simulate successful API responses with fake provider IDs
  * Mock detectConflicts should check against mock events (you can store mock events in memory)
  * Mock suggestReschedules should return sensible time slots (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours later)
* Handle credentials securely (encrypt in real implementation, mock for now with comment)
* Use proper TypeScript types with ID type from @utils/types.ts
* Include clear JSDoc comments explaining mock vs real implementation
* Handle error cases appropriately (connection failures, etc.)

The concept should export a class with all actions as methods.

Note: Real calendar provider integration will be added in a future assignment. For now, focus on the concept structure and working mock implementation.
