# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

\<concept\_spec>
concept EventDrafts \[User, DraftEvent]

purpose
hold structured events before committing and track validation status

principle
after creating a draft, it can be validated and modified before final commitment;
a draft transitions from Created → Proposed → Validated (or Conflicted);
drafts that are validated can be prepared for calendar commitment;
users can attach constraints like buffer times and room requirements;
drafts maintain separation from committed calendar events

operational principle
after user creates a draft event with title, time, location, and attendees,
the system validates basic constraints (end time after start time, non-empty title);
if validation passes, status becomes Proposed;
external systems can check for calendar conflicts;
if no conflicts, draft is marked Validated;
user can then finalize the validated draft for commitment to calendars

state
a set of DraftEvent with
a user User
a title String
a startTime DateTime
an endTime DateTime
a location String
attendees Set<String>
tags Set<Tag>
a status Status // "Created", "Proposed", "Validated", "Conflicted"

```
a set of Constraints with
    a draftEvent DraftEvent
    a bufferBefore Number // minutes before event
    a bufferAfter Number // minutes after event
    a requiresRoom Boolean
    a virtualLink String? // optional video conferencing link

invariants
    every DraftEvent has exactly one status
    status is one of: Created, Proposed, Validated, Conflicted
    endTime is after startTime for all drafts
    every Constraints belongs to exactly one DraftEvent
    buffer times are non-negative
```

actions
create(user: User, title: String, startTime: DateTime, endTime: DateTime, location: String, attendees: Set<String>, tags: Set<Tag>): DraftEvent
requires title is non-empty, endTime is after startTime
effect creates new draft event with status "Created" and default constraints (zero buffers)
note returns the created draft event ID

```
validate(draft: DraftEvent): Status
    requires draft exists
    effect checks basic constraints (time ordering, non-empty title)
    note if valid, status becomes "Proposed"; if invalid, status becomes "Conflicted"
    note returns the resulting status

attachConstraints(draft: DraftEvent, bufferBefore: Number, bufferAfter: Number, requiresRoom: Boolean, virtualLink: String?)
    requires draft exists, buffer times are non-negative
    effect updates or creates constraints for the draft
    note allows specifying travel time, room needs, and video links

updateDraft(draft: DraftEvent, updates: Map<String,Any>)
    requires draft exists, updates contains valid field names
    effect applies updates to draft fields (title, times, location, attendees, tags)
    note resets status to "Created" to require re-validation after changes

markValidated(draft: DraftEvent)
    requires draft exists, draft status is "Proposed"
    effect sets status to "Validated"
    note typically called after external conflict checking passes

markConflicted(draft: DraftEvent)
    requires draft exists
    effect sets status to "Conflicted"
    note typically called when external conflict checking fails

getDraft(draft: DraftEvent): Map<String,Any>
    requires draft exists
    effect returns draft event data, constraints, and current status

getByUser(user: User): Set<DraftEvent>
    effect returns all draft events for the user

deleteDraft(draft: DraftEvent)
    requires draft exists
    effect removes draft event and associated constraints from state
```

notes
EventDrafts maintains clean separation from calendar systems:
\- Drafts are temporary working copies before commitment
\- External systems (CalendarSync) query drafts for conflict checking
\- Status transitions guide the workflow toward committable events

```
Constraints enable intelligent scheduling:
- Buffer times account for travel between locations
- Room requirements can trigger location booking
- Virtual links can be pre-attached for remote meetings

State management:
- Status "Created" means draft was just created, needs validation
- Status "Proposed" means basic validation passed, awaiting conflict check
- Status "Validated" means ready for commitment to calendars
- Status "Conflicted" means validation or conflict check failed

Updates reset status because changes invalidate previous checks
```

\</concept\_spec>

Please implement the EventDrafts concept following the specification above and the implementation guidelines.

Key requirements:

* Use MongoDB collections with PREFIX namespace separation
* Define all internal types (DraftEvent, Tag as IDs)
* Implement all actions from the specification
* Use proper TypeScript types with the ID type from @utils/types.ts
* Follow the pattern shown in LikertSurvey example
* Include clear JSDoc comments
* Handle error cases appropriately (throw errors with descriptive messages)
* Ensure all state invariants are maintained

The concept should export a class with a constructor that takes a Db instance and implements all the actions as methods.
